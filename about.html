<p> I am Brody Pennington, a Freshman undergraduate Computer Science student at East Mississippi Community College.
  Currently, I work as a part-time barista at Southbound Coffee Co and dedicate my free time to College work and personal
  projects. At the moment, this website is my project. I figured one thing that makes people stand out is a website. This
  is pretty basic, but I like it that way. *Minimalism noises*
